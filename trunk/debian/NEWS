lyx (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since version 1.4.2, LyX no longer creates a global configuration file
    with the '/usr/share/lyx/configure' script.
    If you want to reconfigure your LyX setup you can run
    "cd ~/.lyx && /usr/share/lyx/configure.py" by hand or use
    Tools->Reconfigure from LyX's menu.
    A global configuration will be read from '/usr/share/lyx/lyxrc.defaults'
    (provided by the LyX developers) and from '/usr/share/lyx/lyxrc.dist'
    (distribution specific). In the Debian package '/usr/share/lyx/lyxrc.dist'
    is a symlink to '/etc/lyxrc'.
