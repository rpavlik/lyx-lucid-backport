    config.{sub,guess} manually.

    depends on tex-common via ${misc:Depends}, and that's all that's
    really necessary.

    -qt and -xforms frontend packages. Closes: #452888

    left on the system even if you purge the latest package.
    Closes: #454713
  * Added "-- -Z bzip2" to dh_builddeb so that we use bzip2 compression
    for the binary packages instead of gzip.

    deprecated now.

    (only enables assertions for prereleases and devel versions).

  * Use CFLAGS as CXXFLAGS because LyX is C++ code.
  * Adding -ffunctions-sections as a workaround for builds on hppa.
  * Adding texlive-latex-base as an alternative Build-Dep
    (wished by Gudjon I. Gudjonsson)

  * Added -Wl,--as-needed to LDFLAGS.
  * Only give both --build and --host to ./configure if cross-compiling.
  * Unify LyX desktop files. Only include a .desktop file in the lyx
    package. It will use the frontend selected using the alternatives
    system.

    remove anyway.
  * Use the name "LyX Document Processor" as the menu title for lyx.

    This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4fix2 (these are in
    fact bugs of LyX 1.1.4 which were not fixed by the 1.1.4fix[12] patches):
   
    * LyX often crashed after repeated use of the backspace key. This problem
      actually existed since long ago in the program, but did not strike very
      often before version 1.1.4. This is probably the main reason why
      you will want to apply this patch.
    * error insets were not removed correctly, which caused the removal or
      nearby characters in the documents. This is a serious problem too.
    * filenames for images in docbook mode were truncated
    * font tags for SGML output were wrong.
    * -lintl was not added on the link list when compiling on system
      which have gettext installed, but not in libc. 
    * one header file contained C++ comments, whereas it is compiled with a
      C compiler.

  * - fix build problems on some architectures ('fl_gc' symbol not found)
  * - fix warnings about missing return type in X headers for some

  * - fix parsing of LaTeX log files, where some errors got unnoticed.
  * - add support for textclasses with more than 128 layouts (yes some

  * - fix bug with filenames containing more that one "." (for example,
      a.b.lyx was exported to a.ps).
  * - fix partly bug with bibtex files located in the directory of the
      document (now using an absolute path works).
  * - fix bug in math editor, where greek letters (and some other
      symbols) had too much spacing around them.
  * - remove function buffer-previous from binding files, since it is not

lyx (1.1.4-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix1:
  *	The purpose of this patch is to provide some simple fixes to LyX
  *	1.1.4 to ease the wait until the next stable release. It should
  *	probably be applied to binary distributions of LyX 1.1.4, since it
  *	offers better stability.
  *
  *	This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4:
  *
  *	- fix character \"{e} in latin1 encoding
  *	- fix problem when running latex on files which have accented
  *	   characters in their names  
  *	- add support for dvi previewers which do not support the -paper
  *	   option (like yap on NT)
  *	- fix oneside/twoside options in Layout->Document
  *	- fix crash when trying to select a layout which does not exist
