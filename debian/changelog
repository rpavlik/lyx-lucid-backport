lyx (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Per Olofsson ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Should build with g++ 4.1. Closes: #357119.
  * Removed --enable-shared because we don't build any libraries anyway
    and apparently it causes everything to be built twice.
  * Added myself and Sven to Uploaders. Removed Rob Weir since he is
    apparently MIA.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.7.2.
  * List lyx-qt as the first dependency alternative instead of lyx-
    xforms.
  * Break dependency loop by moving dependency on lyx-qt | lyx-xforms to
    Recommends in lyx-common. Closes: #341848.
  * Don't depend on g++-4.0, use the default g++ (with versioned
    dependency).

  [ Sven Hoexter ]
  * Added dvipost to the recommended/suggested packages

  [ Per Olofsson ]
  * Removed manpage for noweb2lyx since the program in question is not
    included anymore.
  * Make all files in /usr/share/lyx/scripts/ executable. Closes:
    #348731.
  * Suppress error message from /usr/share/lyx/configure.

lyx (1.3.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * NMU.
  * Medium urgency for RC bugfix.
  * Removed build-dep on xlibs-dev which doesn't exist anymore. It seems
    that the other build-dep'd packages depend on individual X -dev
    packages in turn.
  * Rebuild against libaiksaurus-1.2-0c2a (libstdc++ allocator change).
    Closes: #342538.

lyx (1.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #275325).
    + It compiles fine with modern gcc, too (Closes: #261364).

    + Fix to not crash on autosave in Russian locales (Closes: #275008).

    comprehensibility.  Thanks to Peter Samuelson, Daniel Stone, Adam Conrad,
    Tollef Fog Heen, Pascal Hakim and Erinn Clark for help along the way.
  * Use dpatch to apply patches to the upstream source.
  * Build against C++-transitioned Aiksaurus (Closes: #321308).

    Thanks to Antonio Biasio, Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña, Alban 
    Browaeys and Peter Samuelson. 
  * Remove debconf note about the lyx-qt/lyx-xforms split; thanks again for
    the translation work, especially: Basilius (ru), Clytie Siddall (vi),

  * Make lyx-common Depend on tetex-bin (Closes: #255368).
  * Include patch from Joe Pfeiffer to add counters for the latex8 article

  * Update lyx manpage to use the correct minus character.
  * Include convert'd 32x32 icon for use in menus.
  * Add versioned build-dep on g++-4.0 to avoid hitting #328684.

lyx (1.1.4-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU requested by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>
  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix3:
    This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4fix2 (these are in
    fact bugs of LyX 1.1.4 which were not fixed by the 1.1.4fix[12] patches):
   
    * LyX often crashed after repeated use of the backspace key. This problem
      actually existed since long ago in the program, but did not strike very
      often before version 1.1.4. This is probably the main reason why
      you will want to apply this patch.
    * error insets were not removed correctly, which caused the removal or
      nearby characters in the documents. This is a serious problem too.
    * filenames for images in docbook mode were truncated
    * font tags for SGML output were wrong.
    * -lintl was not added on the link list when compiling on system
      which have gettext installed, but not in libc. 
    * one header file contained C++ comments, whereas it is compiled with a
      C compiler.

lyx (1.1.4-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix2:
  * This patch fixes the following problems in LyX 1.1.4fix1 (these are in
  * fact bugs of LyX 1.1.4 which were not fixed by the 1.1.4fix1 patch):
  * - fix build problems on some architectures ('fl_gc' symbol not found)
  * - fix warnings about missing return type in X headers for some
      gcc/egcs versions.
  * - fix parsing of LaTeX log files, where some errors got unnoticed.
  * - add support for textclasses with more than 128 layouts (yes some
      people do that!)
  * - fix bug with filenames containing more that one "." (for example,
      a.b.lyx was exported to a.ps).
  * - fix partly bug with bibtex files located in the directory of the
      document (now using an absolute path works).
  * - fix bug in math editor, where greek letters (and some other
      symbols) had too much spacing around them.
  * - remove function buffer-previous from binding files, since it is not
      implemented.
  * Added icon to menu (closes:Bug#58739).
  * Made lintian clean.

lyx (1.1.4-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch-1.1.4fix1:
  *	The purpose of this patch is to provide some simple fixes to LyX

  *
  *	- fix character \"{e} in latin1 encoding
  *	- fix problem when running latex on files which have accented
