lyx (1.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    In the 1.5.x version series, LyX has finally gained UTF-8 support.
  
    Starting with the 1.5.x series, LyX only provides one frontend, based
    on Qt 4. Therefore, we have removed the lyx-qt and lyx-xforms
    packages. All binaries are now included in the lyx package.

lyx (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Since version 1.4.2, LyX no longer creates a global configuration file
    with the '/usr/share/lyx/configure' script.
    If you want to reconfigure your LyX setup you can run
    "cd ~/.lyx && /usr/share/lyx/configure.py" by hand or use
    Tools->Reconfigure from LyX's menu.
