Description: High Level Word Processor
 LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX that runs under the X Window
 System. It makes the power and typesetting quality of LaTeX available for
 people who are used to word processors. Since LyX supports LaTeX's concept
 of general mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create professional
 quality documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also
 possible to use LaTeX-commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's power is
 lost.
 .
 This meta-package installs LyX common files, the frontend (Qt or XForms)
 and other packages needed by LyX.
 .
 This package can be safely removed after install.
 .

  * ispell or aspell: an interactive spelling corrector
  * kdeprint or lpr: a printing tool
  * konqueror or www-browser: allows to view HTML documents
  * kghostview or postscript-viewer: allows to view PostScript documents
  * kghostview or pdf-viewer: allows to view PDF documents
  * sgmltools-lite: allows to export SGML DocBook documents
  * linuxdoc-tools: allows to export SGML LinuxDoc documents
  * rcs: allows to use versioning feature
  * tex4ht or hevea or tth or latex2html: allows to export HTML documents
  * gnuhtml2latex: allows to import HTML documents
  * wv: allows to import Word documents
